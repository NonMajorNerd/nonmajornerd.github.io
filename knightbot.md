## Overview

> KnightBot's primary purpose is to manage the Channel Points RPG. This is a role playing game which is played directly in [NonMajorNerd's Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/nonmajornerd) streams. You can create a Character, hunt for Artifacts, compete against other viewers in friendly competition, and more.

## Getting Started

> To join the Channel Points RPG you must first make a Character. You can do this during [NonMajorNerd's Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/nonmajornerd) stream with the "New Character" Channel Point Redemption found in the Twitch Chat portion of the screen below where you type chat messages. This will cost 100 Nerd Notes - a currency you gain passively by watching NonMajorNerd stream.

> Characters have three primary stats - Fortitude, Reflex, and Willpower. Your Character's base stats are rolled when you create a new Character and will be between 3 and 18.

## Archetypes

> Archetypes are sets of training and gear your Character can take on which modify their stats. There are five Archetype categories with three teirs of rarity each. The more rare the Archetype, the better the corresponding stat modifiers will be.
