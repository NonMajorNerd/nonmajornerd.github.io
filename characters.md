## Characters

Your Character is a combination of statistics, a possible Archetype and Artifact, and your imagination. Your character serves as your representative in the game, your avatar in the Chat RPG world. Like the protagonists of a novel or a movie, Characters are at the center of the gameâ€™s action.

Your Character's in-game objects and abilities are often summarized via the Character Card seen below.
