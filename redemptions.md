## Overview
> Channel point redemptions are the primary way to interact with the Channel Points RPG and your Character. You will passively gain Channel Points (aka Nerd Notes) while watching [NonMajorNerd's Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/nonmajornerd) streams.
>
> Some redemptions may have a Gold cost in addition to the Channel Points. 

## New Character 
> ![New Character Redemption](https://github.com/NonMajorNerd/nonmajornerd.github.io/blob/main/_assets/GFX/KB/Redemptions/arch.png?raw=true) Cost: 100 Nerd Notes <br>
> <i><small>Create a new character for the !KnightBot RPG .. Enter your character's name or 'Random' for a random name. (Names must be 14 characters or fewer.)</small></i>
>
> This redemption is how you create a Character for the Chat RPG. If you have an existing Character, creating a new one will replace that Character.
>
> When a Character is created, KnightBot will generate their primary stats (Fortitude, Reflex, and Willpower) by rolling 4 6-sided dice and taking the sum of those dice excluding the lowest roll.
>
> New Characters start at level one, with 0 experience and 0 Gold. 
>
> More information on Characters can be found on the [Characters](/characters.html) page.

## Buy an Artifact Map

> <i>Buy a treasure map from the loremaster for 45 gold pieces in hopes that it will lead you to an artifact!</i>
>
> When a Character purchases an Artifact Map, they then make a single attempt to follow that map to discover an Artifact.
>
> The attempt to follow the Artifact Map has a 40% base chance of success which is improved by a Character having a high Willpower stat.
>
> Each 2 points of Willpower above 10 adds an additional 10% chance of success. For example a Character with a Willpower of 14 would have a 60% chance to sucessfully discover an Artifact.

>  3. Each character will make a Skill Check using the chosen stat against the difficulty number.
>    - A skill check is a 20-sided dice roll modified by the respective stat. Stats below 10 will have a negative modifier while stats above 10 will have a positive modifer.
>  4. Any Character who fails the Skill Check will have incur one Strike. Any Character with three or more strikes is out of the competition.
>  5. Rounds continue in this fashion until only one of the three competitors remain.
>
> The winning Character of a Feats of Mastery event recieves 20 experience and 30 Gold, while the other two competitors each recieve 10 experience.
