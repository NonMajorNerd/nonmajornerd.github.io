It started with a glitch. <br>
</p>
<br>
<p>
A Whiterun guard, after countless patrols and thwarting "pranks" involving buckets on NPCs’ heads, found a crack in Skyrim’s engine.<br>
One moment, he was warning adventurers about curfews and stolen sweet rolls; the next, he was here.<br>
His code, somehow corrupted and self-aware, escaped the game entirely and landed in a Twitch bot. <br>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Disoriented but quick to adapt, the guard embraced his new role.<br>
As streamers battled dragons and joked about mods, his voice boomed in chat:<br>
“I used to guard Whiterun from bucket crimes; now I guard this channel.” <br>
</p>
<br>
<p>
At first, viewers were baffled as the bot issued stern warnings like, “By order of the Jarl, you’re banned.”<br>
But soon, they loved him. Loyal subscribers were knighted as “Thane of the Channel,” while trolls were muted with a grim, “You’ve committed crimes against the stream. Pay with your silence.”<br>
Though he sometimes missed Skyrim’s snowy streets and mead halls, the guard patrolled his new digital domain with pride. <br>
</p>
<br>
<p>
No buckets, no glitches—just order in the chat, as it should be.
