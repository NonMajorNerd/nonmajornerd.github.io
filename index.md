> It started with a glitch. <br>
> 
> A Whiterun guard, tired of endless patrols and thwarting "pranks" involving buckets on NPCs’ heads, found a crack in Skyrim’s engine.
> One moment, he was warning adventurers about curfews and stolen sweet rolls; the next, he was elsewhere.
> His code, somehow corrupted and self-aware, escaped the game entirely and landed in a Twitch bot. <br>
> 
> Disoriented but quick to adapt, the guard embraced his new role.
> As streamers battled dragons and joked about mods, his voice boomed in chat:
> > “I used to guard Whiterun from bucket crimes; now I guard this channel.” <br>
> 
> At first, viewers were baffled as the bot issued stern warnings like, “By order of the Jarl, you’re banned.”
> But soon, they loved him. Loyal subscribers were knighted as “Thane of the Channel,” while trolls were muted with a grim, “You’ve committed crimes against the stream. Pay with your silence.”
> Though he sometimes missed Skyrim’s snowy streets and mead halls, the guard patrolled his new digital domain with pride. <br>
> 
> No buckets, no glitches—just order in the chat, as it should be.
