## Overview
> An Archetype is a set of training and gear that your Character can take on which modifies their stats. Each Archetype category has three teirs of Archetypes that a Character could recieve.
> One-star Archetypes are considered common (C) and have a 55% chance of occuring, two-star Archetypes are considered uncommon (UC) and have a 35% chance of occurring, and three-star Archetypes are considered rare (R) and have a 10% chance of occuring. A character with no Archetype is referred to as a Peasant.
>
> A Character may only have one Archetype at a time. If a second Archetype is collected, they must choose to either [keep](/commands.html#keeparchetype) their current Archetype or [replace](/commands.html#replacearchetype) it with the newly found Archetype.
